Wii NetPlay by MrBean35000vr and Chadderz

This app is designed to attempt to add online multiplayer to games that have
a local multiplayer service, so that you can play games across the Internet
with your friends who have the same game via the in-game local multiplayer.

It is currently not very pretty and only supports two players. It is only
designed for (and tested with) New Super Mario Bros. Wii, but we give no
guarantee that the game will work properly!

In order to play a game, there must be a designated host. The host must tell
all other players their public IP address, and choose a TCP port to accept
connections on. The host may be required to use port forwarding in their router
to make the connections work.

The other player must enter the host's public IP and port into the config.ini
file located on the SD card at SD:/apps/netslug/config.ini.

Please make sure you have the correct disc inserted before the loader begins,
and compare game ID with your friend to make sure that it is exactly the same.
Games with differing IDs or versions may be less likely to work.

When the app is finished patching the game, and says "A button: Host, B button:
Guest", make sure that the host is the first to select their option. After
the host has the message "Listening on..." on their screen, the other player
should then press their B button. This will cause both Wiis to attempt to
communicate with each other, and if the connection succeeds, the game will
begin. It is advised to keep verbal contact with the person you're playing
with to make sure a desync does not occur (when one Wii does something
differently to the other). If it does occur, the best solution is usually
to reload the game, though you might be able to get away with reloading an
individual level or similar.
